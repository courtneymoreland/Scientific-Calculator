# Overview

As a software engineer, I undertook the development of a Scientific Calculator app to enhance my skills in Android app development. The app is designed to handle various mathematical operations, including standard arithmetic and advanced functions such as square root, factorial, trigonometric functions, and logarithmic functions. This project was an opportunity to apply my knowledge in Java and XML within the Android Studio environment.

Check out the YouTube demonstration for a 4-5 minute walkthrough of the app's features, user interface, and a brief overview of the code.

## Development Environment

* **Android Studio:** The primary integrated development environment for Android app development.
* **Java:** The programming language used for the app's logic.
* **XML:** Used for designing the app's layout and UI.
* **Icon Resources:** Utilized resources from FindIcon and FlatIcon for app icons.

## Useful Websites

* [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs): Official documentation for Android development.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): A community-driven platform for programming Q&A.
* [FindIcon](https://findicons.com/): A resource for finding icons for app development.
* [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/): Another platform for high-quality icons.

## Future Work

In the future, I plan to address the following aspects to enhance the Scientific Calculator app:

* Improve error handling and provide informative messages for invalid expressions.
* Enhance the user interface for a more polished and modern look.
* Explore and implement additional mathematical functions to expand the calculator's capabilities.
* Optimize code for better performance.
* Address any bugs that may arise from user feedback.
